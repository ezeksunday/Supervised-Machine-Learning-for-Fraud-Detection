# Supervised Machine Learning for Fraud Detection: Identifying Anomalous Patterns in Financial Transactions to Mitigate Risks
This project involved developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions.  
By analysing historical data (financial transaction data) to identifies anomalous patterns “indicative of fraudulent activity”.  
The model aims to mitigate potential risks and protect the organization from financial losses. 
By training the model on labelled data, it can effectively distinguish between legitimate and suspicious transactions.  
The model was built using supervised machine learning techniques and leverages the power of data-driven insights to enhance fraud prevention efforts.
The dataset was acquired from a Nigerian Commercial Bank.
